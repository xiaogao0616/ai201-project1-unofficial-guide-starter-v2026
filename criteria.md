# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
All five questions are based on facts stated in my corpus, so a relevant chunk should usually be retrievable. I allow one miss because retrieval can still fail on a less directly worded question.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
Naming a source lets a user trace each answer back to a document in the corpus. I require this for every answer because an answer without a source cannot be checked.

---

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.


**Why this target:**
This checks whether the system can recognize when a question is outside the corpus. I allow one failure because the distance between an out-of-scope question and a loosely related chunk may sometimes be ambiguous.

---

## 4. Something about your chunks

No chunk is shorter than 100 characters or longer than 500 characters.



**Why this target:**
This range should keep each chunk long enough to contain a complete idea, while preventing a chunk from including too much unrelated information. The upper limit is stricter than the starter baseline, whose longest chunk was 549 characters.

---

## 5. Your choice

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the final answer contains the expected word or phrase from questions.py.



**Why this target:**
This checks whether the final generated answer includes the specific fact I decided was necessary before testing. I allow one miss because a model may phrase one answer differently even when the relevant chunk was retrieved.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
